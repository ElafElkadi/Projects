    "Our team studied the relationship between soccer players and how injuries affected their performance. We looked at eighty players across the four major professional leagues and analyzed their injury history, comparing their respective statistics/performance pre-injury and post-injury. We then categorized these players into which positions they played, and studied the differences in injury frequency across these aforementioned positions."

    "*There are two characteristics that any great soccer player possesses; consistency and longevity. These two attributes are influenced by many traits of the player. Some are under their control, like their professionalism or their ambition. Other traits are natural and the player seems to be born with such a natural talent for soccer. However, there is one aspect of a footballer’ success that is somewhat out of their control: the injuries that they will suffer over the course of their career. While some players seem to be particularly prone to injury and a careful training regime or sport science department can reduce the likelihood of injury, many of the injuries that happen on the field cannot be avoided and are often the result of bad luck. All of the attributes mentioned above will collectively determine a player’s consistency and longevity in soccer. Because injuries are such an important part in the development of these players, it undeniably affects the height and time of a player’s peak. On the other end, injuries also tend to herald the decline of a player’s career. In our project, we will analyse the relationship between injuries and consistency of soccer player performance and how the player’s position could determine the frequency at which they suffer injuries.\n",
